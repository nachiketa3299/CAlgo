# CS Algorithms in pure C!

If you know how to do *X* in C then you truly know what you are doing.

This project is all about implementing algorithms in pure C, testing their correctness, and benchmarking their performances along the way.

**Tools Used**
* CMake
* [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest)
* [Google Benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark)
* [Manim](https://www.manim.community/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

Main project produces 1 static library `Calgo` and others depends on it.

Have fun! ðŸ˜Š
